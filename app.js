// Step 1: Create three arithmetic operators, each generates a number (const), combo is 10-40-39 //
const c1 = 8+2; //10//
const c2 = 20*2; //40//
const c3 = 41-2; //39//

//Step 2: String message to the user: You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination://
var message = "You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination: ";

//Step 3: Displays combo in alert//
alert(message + c1 + "-" + c2 + "-" + c3);
